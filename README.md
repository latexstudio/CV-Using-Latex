## What is Awesome CV?

**Awesome CV** is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``

# CV-Using-Latex


I have created my CV using this Latex template. This CV is inspired by the design of Awesome CV. I have simplified some of the designs.


# Latex CV
- You can create your CV using this template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5f3d4d771cf30f0001c5fe7a) very easily.
- You can also clone this project. And then install MiKTex software, and then use CMD to run below command to give your .tex file as input and .pdf as output.
- This CV is inspired by the design of [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV), [Latex_CV](https://github.com/muratcankaracabey/latex_cv), [Mcdowell-CV](https://github.com/dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv). 
- You might think this as a simplified version. I created this project from scratch to learn Latex and the way I wrote might not be the best latex practices. However, it is easy to play with the high level functions provided in [CV.tex](https://github.com/muratcankaracabey/latex_cv/blob/master/CV.tex) file without going too much into the detail to have a certain level of expressiveness in your resume. The simplicity also makes it easy to understand what is going on and also enables to make low level customizations.

### How does it look?

<img src="https://github.com/muratcankaracabey/latex_cv/blob/master/images/example_cv.png" width="425"/> <img src="https://github.com/muratcankaracabey/latex_cv/blob/master/images/coverletter.png" width="425"/> 

### How to use it?
- With minimum effort, you can use the [CV.tex](https://github.com/muratcankaracabey/latex_cv/blob/master/CV.tex) as it is provided with the high level functions such as ```\datedexperience```, ```\explanation```, ```\explanationdetail``` to add elements to your CV. You can create skill elements with ```\newcommand{\skillname{\createskill{<Skill Category>}{<explanation>}}}``` and finally create the list of skills with ```\createskills{<comma seperated skills list>}```. 
- You can also use it for your **cover letter** by just using
  ```
  \setcompanyname{GOOGLE INC.}
  \setcontactperson{Mr.Brown}
  \setclaimedposition{Junior Data Scientist} 
  \coverletter{ %
  <coverlettertext>
  }
  ``` 
  and deleting the rest of sections.
- Of course, if you want to go further you can check the [muratcan_cv.cls](https://github.com/muratcankaracabey/latex_cv/blob/master/muratcan_cv.cls) file. This is my first latex project so it might be error-prone and not as generic as possible(I still have some warnings that needs to be resolved). However I tried to make it understandable for later contributions.
- You can change the header content with the ```set..``` commands in the beginning and also the the color of the theme.
- Just replace the actual texts with your related education/experience and also don't forget to replace ```\lipsum[1][1-12]\par``` with actual texts. That package is just used for illustration reasons. Since I am not sure what to write to those parts of the resume right now.
  
### TODOS

- [ ] Resolve the warnings.

### Warning
- For Mac users, If you use TexShop, you need to locate the AwesomeFont in your file system and load to your system. It is most probably under ```/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public```. Just locate it and double-click install. Then you are good to go.
