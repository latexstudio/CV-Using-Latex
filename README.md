## Quick Start

## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.). You can also install MiKTex for windows.

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
$ xelatex {your-coverletter}.tex
```

You can also store the commands in a file and then run using shell command
```bash
$cat cmd.sh
xelatex cv.tex
xelatex coverLetter.tex
$ sh cmd.sh
```

This should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf`` and ``{your-coverletter}.pdf``


If you don't know Latex, then you can check the guide under latex folder, index.html file. Alternatively there is a zipped version also with name ``latex.tar.gz``

You can download the file instead and unzip the tar file with below command -
```bash
$ tar latex.tar.gz
```

One pre-requisite for all of this commands to run in windows also is - You need to install CMDER and run all this commands not from cmd but from CMDER.

## Credit

[**LaTeX**](http://www.latex-project.org) is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, especially the math and computer science people in academia.

[**LaTeX FontAwesome**](https://github.com/furl/latex-fontawesome) is bindings for FontAwesome icons to be used in XeLaTeX.

[**Roboto**](https://github.com/google/roboto) is the default font on Android and ChromeOS, and the recommended font for Google’s visual language, Material Design.

[**Source Sans Pro**](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro) is a set of OpenType fonts that have been designed to work well in user interface (UI) environments.

This CV is inspired by the design of [**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV), [**Latex_CV**](https://github.com/muratcankaracabey/latex_cv), [**Mcdowell-CV**](https://github.com/dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv).

### How to tweak it?
- With minimum effort, you can use the [CV.tex](https://github.com/muratcankaracabey/latex_cv/blob/master/CV.tex) as it is provided with the high level functions such as ```\datedexperience```, ```\explanation```, ```\explanationdetail``` to add elements to your CV. You can create skill elements with ```\newcommand{\skillname{\createskill{<Skill Category>}{<explanation>}}}``` and finally create the list of skills with ```\createskills{<comma seperated skills list>}```. 
- You can also use it for your **cover letter** by just using
  ```
  \setcompanyname{GOOGLE INC.}
  \setcontactperson{Mr.Brown}
  \setclaimedposition{Junior Data Scientist} 
  \coverletter{ %
  <coverlettertext>
  }
  ``` 
  and deleting the rest of sections.
  

### Warning
- For Mac users, If you use TexShop, you need to locate the AwesomeFont in your file system and load to your system. It is most probably under ```/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public```. Just locate it and double-click install. Then you are good to go.
